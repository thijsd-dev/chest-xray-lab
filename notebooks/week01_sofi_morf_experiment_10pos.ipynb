The goal is to **find a segment ordering that minimizes the area under the MoRF retained curve** (lower AUC = better). I stick to local, instance-based explanations: we measure how the **model’s p(pos)** changes as we progressively replace segments with a neutral **baseline** (the image mean in [0,1]).\n","\n","What’s inside:\n","\n","- **AUC on a fixed grid [0..K] → [0..1].**  \n","  I integrate the retained probability curve \\(y_t = p_t / p_0\\) with a uniform step. This is the objective SOFI tries to minimize.\n","\n","- **Segment indexing (torch-friendly).**  \n","  I precompute per-segment flat indices so I can zero-copy “paint” multiple candidate occlusions in batches on the GPU. This makes everything practical at 100–240 superpixels.\n","\n","- **MoRF curve (batched, cumulative).**  \n","  Given an order, I build a **cumulative batch** of images (each step adds one more occluded segment), run a single forward over that batch, and collect the normalized retained curve. Optional knobs: early stop and (off by default) a monotone envelope for plotting.\n","\n","- **SEED order (greedy baseline).**  \n","  A fast, reasonable starting order: at each step, try occluding each remaining segment **in batch**, pick the one with the largest probability drop, commit it, and repeat.\n","\n","- **RAND baseline.**  \n","  Shuffle orders several times, compute AUCs, and report μ±σ. This is the “uninformed” reference line.\n","\n","- **SOFI via Hill Climbing (HC).**  \n","  Start from an initial order and **swap two positions** to form a candidate. If the AUC improves by more than a tiny tolerance, accept; otherwise, count toward **patience**. Stop when patience is exceeded or max iterations is hit.  \n","  I use a **mixed swap proposal**: half adjacent (local refine), half random (escape local minima). I also support **restarts**: run HC from a greedy init and from a few shuffled inits, keep the global best.\n","\n","Why this design:\n","- Everything is **probability-based** and **cumulative**, matching the assignment’s “probability change after marginalization” requirement.\n","- Batching keeps runtime sane;

everything into a single `evaluate_one_image(...)` that:\n","- builds superpixels for one image;\n","- computes **SEED → RAND → HC (SOFI_HL)** and (optionally) **RL (SOFI_RL)**;\n","- **caches** the resulting MoRF curves + orders to disk to avoid recomputation.\n","\n","### RAW vs BOUNDED metrics (what I report and why)\n","\n","- **RAW is the primary metric.**  \n","  MoRF curves are computed as retained probability \\(y_t = p_t / p_0\\) with **no post-processing**.  \n","  **All tables, macro means, and comparisons are based on RAW AUC (↓ better).**  \n","  This directly reflects the optimization target and keeps results faithful to the deletion protocol.\n","\n","- **BOUNDED is a secondary, robustness view (not used to select winners).**  \n","  To reduce artifacts (small overshoots >1, tiny non-monotone bumps), I also keep a **bounded & gently monotone** version  \n","  \\(\\tilde y = \\mathrm{cummin}(\\mathrm{clip}(y,0,1) + \\varepsilon)\\).  \n","  I report **BOUNDED AUC** only as a **sanity / visualization aid**: it stabilizes plots, helps compare shapes, and  \n","  guards against spiky noise without changing the underlying orders. It is **never used to optimize or rank methods**.\n","\n","### Key controls\n","\n","- **`do_rl` switch**  \n","  - `do_rl=False` → SEED + HC only (matches the “HC if RL not necessary” requirement).  \n","  - `do_rl=True`  → also runs the RL ablation (same MoRF objective).\n","\n","- **Caching (`cache_dir`)**  \n","  - If set (here: `…/manifests/week1_sofi_curves/arrays`), the function takes a **fast path**: load `*.npz` (curves/orders)  \n","    and `*.json` (meta/AUCs).  \n","  - If **HL/SEED** exist, they’re **not recomputed**; only cheap RAND μ±σ is refreshed.  \n","  - If **RL** is requested but missing, it computes **RL only**, appends `y_rl/yb_rl/order_rl` into the same `.npz`, and updates JSON.\n","\n","- **Sanity checks**  \n","  - Every MoRF curve has **K+1 points** (t=0..K).  \n","  - The **final retained value** equals the model probability on an **all-baseline image** divided by \\(p_0\\) (normalization check).\n","\n","### Outputs & files\n","\n","- **Return dict (per image):** primary **RAW AUCs** (HL/RL/SEED, plus RAND μ±σ), **secondary BOUNDED AUCs**,  \n","  **k@0.1** (HL/RL), and meta (iters, stop reason).  \n","- **On disk:**  \n","  - `sofi_K160_c10_s10_lab0__person294_virus_611.jpeg.npz` → arrays: `y_seed`, `y_hl`, optional `y_rl`, `segmap`, and `order_*`.  \n","  - Matching `.json` → params and AUC summaries.\n","\n","**TL;DR:** I grade and compare on **RAW AUC (primary)**, and include **BOUNDED curves** to provide a clean, monotone visualization and robustness check—useful for interpreting noisy regions but not for deciding

so methods are compared apples-to-apples.\n","\n","**What the cell actually does**\n","- **Load-or-compute SOFI:** For each image, try to load `…/manifests/week1_sofi_curves/arrays/*.npz`. If missing, compute once (`SEED → HL (SOFI_HL) → optional RL (SOFI_RL)`) and cache both **curves** and **orders**.\n","- **Compute SOTA on the fly:** Grad×Input, IG, Score-CAM, DeepLIFT, GradientSHAP, Occlusion, Grad-CAM. Each method produces a **segment order** which is fed into the **same MoRF engine** (cumulative marginalization to the **image-mean baseline**).\n","- **One protocol for all:** Same grayscale input range \\([0,1]\\), same baseline value (per-image mean), same cumulative forward occlusion, and same normalization \\(y_t = p_t / p_0\\). That makes the resulting **RAW AUC** directly comparable across methods.\n","\n","**What the legend/AUCs mean**\n","- **RAW retained AUC (↓ better) is the metric of record.** The numbers in the legend are computed on the **unmodified** MoRF curves (no clamping/envelopes). All tables and conclusions use RAW AUC.\n","- **Bounded view is for readability only.** Curves are **drawn** with a gentle monotone envelope (clip to \\([0,1]\\) + cumulative-min) to suppress tiny upward wiggles and overshoots that come from batching / FP32 noise. This does **not** affect the AUC we report.\n","\n","**Different K across images**\n","- Superpixel counts \\(K\\) can vary slightly even with fixed `n_segments`. For **macro plots**, every curve is **resampled to a common grid on \\([0,1]\\)** (fraction of segments removed) before averaging. This aligns the x-axis without changing each method’s deletion order or objective.\n","\n","**Legend and clutter control**\n","- Entries are **sorted by RAW AUC (ascending)** so the best lines are listed first.\n","- Per-image and macro plots show only the **top-N** lines in the legend (configurable). The rest remain in the figure but don’t bloat the legend.\n","- SOFI lines use solid strokes; SEED uses dotted; SOTA uses dashed—so you can identify families at a glance.\n","\n","**Reproducibility & edge handling**\n","- Per-image seeds are offset (e.g., `seed + i*…`) so stochastic baselines (RAND in tables) and RL proposals don’t collide across images.\n","- If a SOTA method fails (e.g., missing target conv for CAM), it is silently skipped for that image; the plot remains consistent.\n","- Sanity checks on SOFI curves: \\(K+1\\) points (including \\(t=0\\)), and the endpoint equals \\(p(\\text{all-baseline})/p_0\\).\n","\n","**Interpreting shapes**\n","- **Down then up** in RAW plots can happen (localized non-monotonicity) because probabilities are re-evaluated on batches of cumulatively masked images; minor ups are expected noise. In the **bounded** view these are flattened, which is why bounded shapes look stair-like and easier to compare. The ranking still comes from RAW.\n","\n","> **TL;DR:** We **display** both RAW and BOUNDED (for readability), but we **judge** only on **RAW AUC** under a single, shared MoRF

**Grad-CAM/GradientSHAP/Score-CAM** are generally worse. This ordering holds on the averaged (macro) curves, not just on a single case.\n","\n","- **Early-drop behavior matters.**  \n","  Methods that drive the curve down quickly (left side) remove truly critical regions first. The best methods show an early, steep decline; weaker ones decline late or wobble.\n","\n","- **Segmentation granularity \\(K\\) changes the story.**  \n","  Performance and visual shape are **sensitive to the superpixel count**:  \n","  - Smaller \\(K\\) → coarse segments; occlusion steps are few but impactful.  \n","  - Larger \\(K\\) → finer control; more steps but also more variance per step.  \n","  Comparisons should use the **same \\(K\\)** (and SLIC params) to be fair.\n","\n","- **Baseline choice influences MoRF.**  \n","  We replace occluded regions with the **training preprocessed mean** (scalar, in \\([0,1]\\)).

methods.  \n","  - Small ups/downs (BN/noise/thresholding effects) make RAW curves **noisy**—especially at high occlusion rates and large \\(K\\).  \n","  - **Bounded curves** apply a gentle monotone
